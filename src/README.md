# OOP-Laboratory-Work-1
Laboratory Work on OOP nr.1 at TUM

Assignment 1:   (Player.java)
<br>
Create a class in a language and editor of your choice (Java, Python, C++, C#) that:
<br>
• Stores information about the object (to represent an object’s state - moving/standing,
it’s speed or color);
<br>
• Has a method for informing the user of it’s state (printing it’s state to the console);

Assingment 2:   (FCMember.java)
<br>
Challenge #4
Categorize a member
<br>
We are building a member system for a small football club. When adding a new user
we want to automatically assign a category based on member’s age if it is greater
than 55 and if he has a handicap greater than 7.
```java
Member member = new Member(“Don”, 34, 9);
member.printCategory() // OPEN
Member member1 = new Member(“Don”, 64, 3);
member1.printCategory() // OPEN
Member member2 = new Member(“Don”, 56, 9);
member2.printCategory() // SENIOR
```
Assingment 3: (User.java)
<br>
Challenge #1
ABBREVIATE THE NAME:
<br>
We have a class User with two fields: firstName and lastName of type String.
The client asked us to display the initials at the bottom of a business-related document, so we need to
create a method inside User class that will convert:
```java
Ion Doe -> I. D.
Miley Cyrus -> M. C
```
Assingment 4: (MathUtils.java)
<br>
Challenge #2
Multiples of 3 or 5:
<br>
You are to write a method inside MathUtils class that will take as a parameter a number, and you’re to
print the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5.
```java
10 -> 23 (3 5 6 9)
```
