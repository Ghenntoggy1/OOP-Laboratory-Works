# Lab 1: University Management System Documentation
**Student:** Gusev Roman

**Group:** FAF-222

<a name="tasks"></a>
## Tasks
### General Task
> Design a Student Management application for Technical University of Moldova.

### Limitations
>* No third party libraries are allowed, you can use only the libraries that are
  available by default.
>* You are free to create as many classes as you need to achieve a well structured
   working system.
>* No limitation of concepts: You can create interface classes, use concepts like
   Polymorphism, Inheritance, Abstraction if you deem necessary. It is not a
   must!

### Base Tasks
>Build a program loop, an interactive command line for the TUM Board to be able to do the
next operations:
> 
> 
>* Faculty operations:
>  * Create and assign a student to a faculty.
>  * Graduate a student from a faculty.
>  * Display current enrolled students (Graduates would be ignored).
>  * Display graduates (Currently enrolled students would be ignored).
>  * Tell or not if a student belongs to this faculty.
>
> 
>* General operations:<a name="general"></a>
   >  * Create a new faculty.
>  * Search what faculty a student belongs to by a unique identifier (for example by email
      or a unique ID).
>  * Display University faculties.
>  * Display all faculties belonging to a field. (Ex. FOOD_TECHNOLOGY)

### Improved
>Design a saving and loading system for the Student Management system.

### Working System
>* Design an operation Logging System.
>
>* Add extra operations:
   >  * Batch enrollment operation for students via a text file.
>  * Batch graduation operation for students via text file.
>  * Validate inputs with meaningful error statements. **_(Canâ€™t graduate student:
     ivan@isa.utm.md (student not present), Operation <operation> is not a
     valid operation, Operation requires extra data etc.)_**

## Used Tools
* The entire code in written in Java programming language in [IntelliJ IDEA Environment](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* In order to track the evolution of the code, I used [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [gitHub](https://github.com/), I worked on different branches for different tasks, that, in the end, I merged with main and deleted afterward

## Getting the code

You can download a copy of all the files in this repository by cloning the
[git](https://git-scm.com/) repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Ghenntoggy1/OOP-Laboratory-Works.git

## Functionality
I have implemented all the required functionalities in the [Tasks Section](#tasks)

## Usage
> In order to start the application, start 
> ``` java
> UniversityManagementSystem.java class (it holds the main function)
> ```

> You will get to introduce a username
> ```console
> | INPUT YOUR USERNAME: |
> ```
> This username will be used in Logger, it will be display who was the person that interacted with the System

> Eventually, you will get access to the Start Menu 
> ```console

> For the Batch functionality, I provided a log.txt file that is empty and a folder DataBases, that will
> hold the information about faculties, students and store them. Also, additionally, I created
> the function to reset the databases, that will empty faculty text file and will delete all related 
> to a specific faculty information.
> 
> In order to batch, be careful, batch graduation is based on the ID of the student
> whilst batch enrollment will load all the data necessary for the Student instantiation

> Batch Enrollment text file looks like this
> ```text
> John,Doe,johndoe@example.com,01-01-2023,15-05-2000,true,clc
> Alice,Smith,alicesmith@example.com,15-02-2023,20-04-2001,true,anm

> ```

> Batch Graduation text file looks like this
> ```text
> 1
> 3
> 5
> 7
> 10
> 2
> ```

> There are a lot of handling operations that will not give the possibility to crash the program

> Every operation in the system is registered in the log, errors are included too.

> ```

> Everytime you quit the program, it will ask you to save or reset the database
> ```console
> +------------------------------------+
> | DO YOU WANT TO SAVE OR RESET DATA? |

> +------------------------------------+

> 
> Based on your choice, as I described above, will be emptied the database folder or saved the last state of the university
> in those txt files. Talking about the Logger, if you reset the log file, it will display only the moment when it was reset
